### nds-bootstrap

nds-bootstrap is a homebrew applications which aims to allow users play DS ROMS on your SD card. It can also be used as a flashcard loader, which can be useful for flashcards that do not normally support ROM loading, like Games n Music & Action Replay DSi. It is also the only open-source ROM loader for the hardware. However, not every game is compatible, so you'll check the compatibility list. If a game is recorded but is for an outdated version or a game isn't recorded at all, you can try it yourself. If you'd like to add a game to the compatibility list, ask an admin to give you access.
